# Castle-Token-Generator
Castle Token Generator — A lightweight local API that generates Castle browser request tokens using headless Chromium.  Send your publishable key (pk) and the Castle JS script link (js) to `/generate` and then fetch the token from `/token`. ⚠️ Tokens are short-lived. Use only on sites you own or are authorized to test.
